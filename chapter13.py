Exercise 13.1. Write a program that reads a file, breaks each line into words, strips whitespace and
punctuation from the words, and converts them to lowercase.
'''

import string

# create a dict in which each item shows how many times each word was used
def read_file(filename):
    d = {}
    data = open(filename)
    
    # for each line in the data, replace the hyphen by the empty string
    for line in data:
        line = line.replace('-', ' ')

     # for each splited line, remove the punctuation and whitespace,turn each word into the lowercase
        for word in line.split():
            word = word.strip(string.punctuation + string.whitespace)
            word = word.lower()

            d[word] = d.get(word, 0) + 1

  Exercise 13.2. Go to Project Gutenberg (http: // gutenberg. org ) and download your favorite
out-of-copyright book in plain text format.
Modify your program from the previous exercise to read the book you downloaded, skip over the
header information at the beginning of the file, and process the rest of the words as before.
Then modify the program to count the total number of words in the book, and the number of times
each word is used.
Print the number of different words used in the book. Compare different books by different authors,
written in different eras. Which author uses the most extensive vocabulary?
'''

# total number of words = sum of the frequencies in the book
def total_words(d):
    return sum(d.values())


# total number of DIFFERENT words = the number of key-value pairs
def different_word(d):
    return len(d)


d = read_file('filename')
print('Total number of words:', total_words(d))
print('Number of different words:', different_word(d))

Exercise 13.3. Modify the program from the previous exercise to print the 20 most frequently used
words in the book.
'''

# Approach 1: Use dictionary and tuples

def common_words(d):
    dc = []
    for word, freq in d.items():
        dc.append((freq, word))
    dc.sort(reverse=True)

d = read_file(filename)
t = common_words(d)

print('The most common words are:')
for freq, word in t[:20]:
    print(word, freq, sep='\t')         # use the keyword argument sep to tell print to use a tab character as a “separator”
    
    
    
# Approach 2: Use sorted
def common_words(d):
    dc = sorted(d.items(), key=lambda item: item[1], reverse=True)
    return dc

d = read_file(filename)
t = common_words(d)

print('The most common words are:')
for word, freq in t[:20]:
    print(word, freq, sep='\t')



'''
Exercise 13.4. Modify the previous program to read a word list (see Section 9.1) and then print all
the words in the book that are not in the word list. How many of them are typos? How many of
them are common words that should be in the word list, and how many of them are really obscure?

Exercise 13.5. Write a function named choose_from_hist that takes a histogram as defined in
Section 11.2 and returns a random value from the histogram, chosen with probability in proportion
to frequency. For example, for this histogram:
>>> t = ['a', 'a', 'b']
>>> hist = histogram(t)
>>> hist
{'a': 2, 'b': 1}
your function should return 'a' with probability 2/3 and 'b' with probability 1/3.
